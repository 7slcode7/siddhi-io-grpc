Features grpc ( Sink ) This extension publishes event data encoded into GRPC Classes as defined in the user input jar. This extension has a default gRPC service classes added. The default service is called \"EventService\". Please find the protobuf definition here . This grpc sink is used for scenarios where we send a request and don't expect a response back. I.e getting a google.protobuf.Empty response back. grpc-call ( Sink ) This extension publishes event data encoded into GRPC Classes as defined in the user input jar. This extension has a default gRPC service classes jar added. The default service is called \"EventService\". Please find the protobuf definition here . This grpc-call sink is used for scenarios where we send a request out and expect a response back. In default mode this will use EventService process method. grpc-call-response source is used to receive the responses. A unique sink.id is used to correlate between the sink and its corresponding source. grpc-service-response ( Sink ) This extension is used to send responses back to a gRPC client after receiving requests through grpc-service source. This correlates with the particular source using a unique source.id grpc ( Source ) This extension starts a grpc server during initialization time. The server listens to requests from grpc stubs. This source has a default mode of operation and custom user defined grpc service mode. By default this uses EventService. Please find the proto definition here In the default mode this source will use EventService consume method. This method will receive requests and injects them into stream through a mapper. grpc-call-response ( Source ) This grpc source receives responses received from gRPC server for requests sent from a grpc-call sink. The source will receive responses for sink with the same sink.id. For example if you have a gRPC sink with sink.id 15 then we need to set the sink.id as 15 in the source to receives responses. Sinks and sources have 1:1 mapping grpc-service ( Source ) This extension implements a grpc server for receiving and responding to requests. During initialization time a grpc server is started on the user specified port exposing the required service as given in the url. This source also has a default mode and a user defined grpc service mode. By default this uses EventService. Please find the proto definition here In the default mode this will use the EventService process method. This accepts grpc message class Event as defined in the EventService proto. This uses GrpcServiceResponse sink to send reponses back in the same Event message format. Dependencies There are no other dependencies needed for this extension.

If this is provided then server authentication is enabled - STRING Yes No truststore.password the password of truststore. If this is provided then the integrity of the keystore is checked - STRING Yes No truststore.algorithm the encryption algorithm to be used for server authentication - STRING Yes No tls.store.type TLS store type - STRING Yes No keystore.file the file path of keystore. If this is provided then client authentication is enabled - STRING Yes No keystore.password the password of keystore - STRING Yes No keystore.algorithm the encryption algorithm to be used for client authentication - STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @source(type='grpc-service', receiver.url='grpc://localhost:8888/org.wso2.grpc.EventService/process', source.id='1', @map(type='json', @attributes(messageId='trp:messageId', message='message'))) define stream FooStream (messageId String, message String); Here a grpc server will be started at port 8888. The process method of EventService will be exposed for clients. source.id is set as 1. So a grpc-service-response sink with source.id = 1 will send responses back for requests received to this source. Note that it is required to specify the transport property messageId since we need to correlate the request message with the response. EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='grpc-service-response', source.id='1', @map(type='json')) define stream BarStream (messageId String, message String); @source(type='grpc-service', receiver.url='grpc://134.23.43.35:8080/org.wso2.grpc.EventService/process', source.id='1', @map(type='json', @attributes(messageId='trp:messageId', message='message'))) define stream FooStream (messageId String, message String); from FooStream select * insert into BarStream; The grpc requests are received through the grpc-service sink. Each received event is sent back through grpc-service-source. This is just a passthrough through Siddhi as we are selecting everything from FooStream and inserting into BarStream. EXAMPLE 3 @source(type='grpc-service', source.id='1' receiver.url='grpc://locanhost:8888/org.wso2.grpc.EventService/consume', @map(type='json', @attributes(name='trp:name', age='trp:age', message='message'))) define stream BarStream (message String, name String, age int); Here we are getting headers sent with the request as transport properties and injecting them into the stream. With each request a header will be sent in MetaData in the following format: 'Name:John', 'Age:23' EXAMPLE 4 @sink(type='grpc-service-response', source.id='1', message.id='{{messageId}}', @map(type='protobuf', @payload(stringValue='a',intValue='b',longValue='c',booleanValue='d',floatValue = 'e', doubleValue ='f'))) define stream BarStream (a string,messageId string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); @source(type='grpc-service', receiver.url='grpc://134.23.43.35:8888/org.wso2.grpc.test.MyService/process', source.id='1', @map(type='protobuf', @attributes(messageId='trp:message.id', a = 'stringValue', b = 'intValue', c = 'longValue',d = 'booleanValue', e = 'floatValue', f ='doubleValue'))) define stream FooStream (a string,messageId string, b int,c long,d bool,e float,f double); from FooStream select * insert into BarStream; Here a grpc server will be started at port 8888. The process method of the MyService will be exposed to the clients.source.id is set as 1.So a grpc-service-response sink with source.id = 1 will send responses back for requests received to this source. Note that it is required to specify the transport property messageId since we need to correlate the request message with the response.","title":"grpc-service (Source)"}]}
